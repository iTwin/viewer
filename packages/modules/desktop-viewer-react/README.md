# iTwin Viewer for Desktop

The iTwin Desktop Viewer is a configurable iTwin.js viewer that offers basic tooling and widgets out-of-the-box and can be further extended through the use of [iTwin.js UI Providers](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/ui/augmentingui/). This package should be used for Electron-based desktop applications. For web applications, use [@itwin/web-viewer-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itwin/web-viewer-react).

# Development

When making changes to the src, run `npm start` in the package's root folder to enable source watching and rebuild, so the dev-server will have access to updated code on succesful code compilation.
