# iTwin Viewer Create React App Template for Web

This is a template for web applications that are based on the [iTwin Viewer](https://github.com/itwin/viewer/tree/main/packages/modules/web-viewer-react) for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To use this template, add `--template @itwin/web-viewer` when creating a new app. You should also use the `@bentley/react-scripts` scripts version to compile your application.

For example:

```sh
pnpm dlx create-react-app@latest my-app-name --template @itwin/web-viewer --scripts-version @bentley/react-scripts
```
