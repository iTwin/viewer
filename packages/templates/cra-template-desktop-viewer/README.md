# iTwin Viewer Create React App Template for Desktop

This is a template for desktop applications that are based on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and the [iTwin Viewer](https://github.com/itwin/viewer/tree/main/packages/modules/desktop-viewer-react) for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To create the application using the template, use pnpm. For information on installing pnpm, click [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).

To use this template, add `--template @itwin/desktop-viewer` when creating a new app. You should also use the @bentley/react-scripts scripts version to compile your application.

For example:

```sh
pnpm dlx create-react-app my-app-name --template @itwin/desktop-viewer --scripts-version @bentley/react-scripts

# or

yarn create react-app my-app-name --template @itwin/desktop-viewer --scripts-version @bentley/react-scripts
```
